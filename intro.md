## Introduction
  Hi! I'm Bernard Gonzales, residing in Batac, Ilocos Norte. A weeb (as you can see in my username), gamer, and sometimes a lazytard (alright most of the time).

## Why Computer Science?
  In my childhood days I've been an addict for mobile games (those for Nokia) and some certain PC games (those old games like Bejeweled, Chuzzle, Pizza Frenzy, etc.)
  and at some point I've wondered how they were able to come up with such games, including how it was made, the game theory behind it, and how they've implemented it.
  This curiosity and interest grew when I took computer science subjects in High School. To be honest I got lucky getting a headstart on having some skills needed
  to pursue my interests. I'm aspiring to be a game dev someday.
